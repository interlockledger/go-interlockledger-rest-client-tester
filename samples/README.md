# Samples directory

This directory contains some JSON samples that are used to perform calls to the
**InterlockLedger REST API**. Most of those samples are just structural and do
not contain actual valid data to perform the calls.

Refer to the **InterlockLedger REST API** documentation to get more information
about how those templates need to be filled.
